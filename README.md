# Project Description

This project is for the class COSI-107a: Computer Security at Brandeis University. In this class we were introduced to many low-level computing concepts, one of which I wished to learn more about: C. For some reason, low-level programming in C caught my eye, which is why this project is written in C. It is a simulation of a fake ransomware, which will encrypt a specific file named *"HOLD_ME_FOR_RANSOM.txt"*. In order to decrypt the file, you must press the correct letter key, which will be chosen at random.
